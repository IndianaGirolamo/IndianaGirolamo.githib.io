	 <h2 class="left_align"> The Special Olympics </h2>
	 <img src="images/event1.jpg" class="medImg">
	 <p> The Special Olympics in Massachusetts invited us out to their summer games to cheer on their athletes. We had an absolute blast taking photo with them and their families. <br> <br> </p>
	 
	 
	 <h2 class="left_align"> <br> Princess Vs. Super Heroes </h2>
	 <img src="images/event3.jpg" class="medImg"> 
	 <p> We showed up to benefit the 'Walk Now for Autism Speaks 2015'. There was a big raffle with awesome prizes and a Horse Drawn Cinderella Carriage. </p>
	 
	 
	 <h2 class="left_align"> <br> Cupcakes for Heroes 2015 </h2>
	 <img src="images/event5.jpg" class="medImg"> 
	 <p> Our biggest crew yet joined Splitsville at Patriot Place for their annual Cupcakes for Heroes event, hosted by Hero Helpers of America. Our heroes (and a few villains!) helped families and kids decorate cupcakes for local shelters and veterans, from unpacking supplies and folding boxes to adding superhero touches to the cupcakes. </p>
	
	 
	 
	 <h2 class="left_align"> Avengers Day: Brookline Public Library </h2>
	 <img src="images/event2.jpg" class="medImg">
	 <p> We joined forces with the Brookline Public Library for an Avengers Day in May. Children came in costume to take pictures, test their super hero trivia knowledge, and made their own hero masks. Who knew you could meet Iron Man or Wolverine while checking out a book? </p>
	 
	 <h2 class="left_align"> <br> Finish at the 50 at Patriot Place </h2>
	 <img src="images/event4.jpg" class="medImg">
	 <p> We cheered on all the runners and posed for pictures with the kids during Havard Pilgrim's Finish at the 50. A portion of the proceeds went to the Kraft Center for Community Health. </p>
	 
	<h2 class="left_align"> <br> Superhero Family Day with the Hartford Wolf Pack and Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research </h2> 
	<img src="images/event6.jpg" class="medImg">
	<p> We teamed up with Team Vermon Cosplay to bring beloved costumes characters to Hartford, CT for a hockey game to benefit the Michael J Fox Foundation. </p>
