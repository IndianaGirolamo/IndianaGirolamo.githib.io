<p> <br> In 2014, an Iron Man cosplayer met several other Marvel cosplayers at a convention. They decided to start a social community for comic book fans in Boston. This group started small with less than twenty members that went to see <i> Captain America: The Winter Solder</i> together in costume. As time went by, the group grew in number and activity. Today, Causeplay New England is made up of a network of over 600 comic book fans from all over New England. Many of us realized that we have a common pop culture interest and want to use our costuming talents to help others. <br> <br>	

Causeplay New England is an organization committed to uniting comic book fans with communities around New England to make a difference. All of our heroes and villains are volunteers that are excited about dressing up and helping out. Our goal is to make your favorite cast of characters come to life for various charity events and hospital visits for kids. <br> <br> 
	
If you are looking to include super heroes at your next event, or perhaps you want to suit up and join us, please see our "Get Involved" page for more information. If you'd like to see some of our members' costumes, check out our photo gallery! </p>
