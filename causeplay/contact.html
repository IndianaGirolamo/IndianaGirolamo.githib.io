<!-- Hi! If you're reading this, then you have taken the time to look at the source code! 
Thanks for being interest in the world of web design and being curious about how things work!
This is my first real project, and I'm doing it for free... partly because i'm inexperienced. :x 
With that set aside, I went to high school with the founder of this group, and i'm very inspired to see what it has become.
I hope this organization inspires you to do something great with yourself; life doesn't have to be all about sex, drugs, and rock n roll. -->
