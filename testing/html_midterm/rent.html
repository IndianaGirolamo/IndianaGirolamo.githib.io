	<h2> The Benefits of Renting </h2>
	<p> Renting has a lot of benefits to it. For one, a down payment is not necessary, which lets you invest that money in other faucets of your life. Some landlords will pay for your utilities as well as let you move out within a 30-days notice if you are unsatified. <br /> <br> Please look at our current rental offerings below. Prices are available upon phone call. </p>  <br />

	<img src="images/gable.jpg" alt="The House of Seven Gables">
	<p> This 17th century home is available to rent, but will not last long. This house is in the center of a bustling town center and has been completely renovated by professional contractors who specialize in 17th century homes. With 200 amps of electricity, a sophisticated water heater, and electric heat, you can enjoy modern amenities without feeling like you're in a 17th century home!</p>

	<img src="images/george.jpg" alt="Georgian Style Home">
	<p> The Georgian style is the housing style of many recognized college dorms, such as Harvard University and Darmouth College. This piece of home can be rented out for much less than you think, despite its high-regard. Georgian-style homes have lovely fireplaces, 3rd story windows, and heavy doors for great insulation.  </p>

	<div class="section1">
	<img src="images/federal.jpg" alt="Federal Style Home">
	<p> The Federal Style is the housing-style of Salem, MA and is now available to rent. These houses are recognizable by the diminished 3rd story windows, windows surrounding the front door, and flat roofs for easy snow removal. These are the housing-style choices for businesses and the Massachusetts State House.  </p>

	<div class="section1">
	<img src="images/bungalow.jpg" alt="bungalow style home">
	<p> The Bungalow house is just old enough to become a historic home and is now available to rent. These homes are perfect for small families that do not need a lot of space. They are recognizable by big yards, two stories in a compact design, and situated on quiet streets! </p>
