	<h2> Ready to sell? </h2> <h3> Excellent! Here are a few simple steps that we will review with you before listing and showing your home. Be prepared. </h3>
	
	<ol> 
	
		<li> <b> Ask yourself a question: Would you buy this home? </b> If there are parts of your home that you dislike or think that are not up to par, now is your time to renovate them (but make sure they're in-theme to your current home architecture). </li> <br /> 
	
		<li> <b> Have realistic expectations: </b> Evaluate the current houses and recent-market comparables to your own home. You will not sell your home for $3,500,000 if other houses with your same specifications in your area have sold for around $1,000,000. <br /> <br />
		When being presented offers, greed is the ultimate vice. While is it important to ensure you're getting top-dollar, be reasonable with an offer that is $5,000 less than your asking price. 
		</li> <br />
		
		<li> <b> Ensure that your home is presentable: </b> Potential buyers will be observing your home and trying to envision their family in it. Ensure that all of your non-essential items, including personal and/or questionable items, are packed or hidden away from plain sight. </li>
