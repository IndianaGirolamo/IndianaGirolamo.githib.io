	<img src="italian.jpg" alt="italianate style home">
	<p> This featured Italianate home features tall windows and give out a lot of natural sunlight. Situated in a historic town with a lively nightlife. The tall windows let in more sunlight than regular windows, and give the Italianate look it's uniqueness. Matched with a Cupola at the top, this is a home you'll always be in love with. </p>
	</div> 
	
	<div class="section1">
	<img src="queen.jpg" alt="Queen Anne Victorian style home">
	<p> This Queen Anne Victorian home is a magnificent home.  The tower gives off a majestic feel and two porches are great for watching thunderstorms. Match this home with one of the highest-rated school systems in the country, and you'll never want to leave this home again! </p> 
	</div> 
	
	<div class="section1">
	<img src="greek.jpg" alt="Greek Revival Style Home">
	<p> This restored Greek Revival-era home is great for a family that wants the experience of a historic home with a modern infrastructure. Flat windows, oddly-positioned doors, and even an in-law apartment; this house has it all! </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section1">
	<img src="gothic.jpg" alt="Gothic-Style home">
	<p> This gothic-style home mixes some Italianate elements to it in order to give it a fresh, unique look. The pointed gable with a window enables the main staircase inside the house to be bathed in light during the day. At night, the windows are big enough for the staircase to be illuminated in moonlight; you'll never need to purchase an man-made nightlight! </p>
