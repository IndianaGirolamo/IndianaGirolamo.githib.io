<h2> My Projects </h2>

<div class="project1"> 

	<!-- 
	
	This is an old project, so I'm still considering if it's worth displaying. Since you took the time to get here, you could view this project if you'd like!
	
	<h2> As Good As It Gets Cafe </h2> 
	<a href="agaig/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project1.png"> </a> 
	<p> This website was the first project that I did on my own for skill-building. As Good As It Gets Cafe is a restaurant that I visit frequently. I decided to recreate their website based on my interpretation. I used the company's colors for the color scheme, which I believe worked pretty well. For the Online menu, the official website uploads their real, paper menu via PDF. While this is a easy-to-implement approach and gets the job done for desktop users, I feel like this is a cumbersome experience for mobile users on cellular networks. I opted for a full HTML menu with links within the page. This would enable users to jump to each food section of the menu, opposed to opening each PDF and hoping to see the section that wished to browse. </p> -->

	<h2> Historic Homes Realty (Midterm for HTML Class) </h2>
	<a href="html_midterm/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project3.png" class="border"> </a>
	<p> My HTML professor was a Realtor by day, and a web design and development instructor by night. For our midterm project, he wanted us to design our own realty website using the tools and techniques that we used throughout the semester. I focused on a historic homes website since I am most familiar with older-style homes, and it could have been the most unique compared to other projects. The page required an index, buy, sell, and rent page, with a contact page as extra credit. </p> 

	<h2> Kent Ristorante - HTML Final Project </h2>
	<a href="html_final/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project5.png"> </a>
	<p> My HTML final project was to create a Italian restaurant's website using the tools and methods we learned in class. This was a group project, and I had 3 other classmates in my group. I had prior experience with CSS, so I did a majority of the CSS code. Despite this, no design element was implemented without a majority approval from the group. We all were pleased with the final project, and out of 3 total groups, ours was picked to be the best website via a panel of volunteer judges. </p>

	<h2> Material Design Inspired Website </h2>
	<a href="matDesignTrade/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project7.png"></a>
	<p> My internship challenged me to make two different styles of websites. This is my first style. It was inspired by Google's own Material Design. This site uses brighter colors and a big sans-serif font. </p>

	<h2> Text Field Validation via JavaScript </h2>
	<a href="Validation/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/validation.png"></a>
	<p> This is a text-field validation that is checked via JavaScript. This uses regular expressions to determine valid input, alerts the user that they've entered an invalid answer, and changes them to a valid input. This was part of my final assignment for a JavaScript course.

	<h2> 1990s Video Game Database - XML/XSL</h2>
	<a href="gaming90s/gaminginthe90s.xml" target="_blank"><img src="images/gaming90s.PNG"></a>
	<p>This was my final project for my XML/XSLT class. As the name implies, it was a small database of 1990s video games using XML for storage and XSL for controlling the storage. A lot of information was able to be reused recurisvely using XML attributes. XML information such as 'release year' and 'developers' were assigned unique id numbers, and those numbers would be included in the game entry's XML tag's attribute section. It enabled me to produce the same results with less typing and utilized XML and XSL's potential.</p>
	
	<h2> Causeplay New England </h2>
	<a href="causeplay/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project2.png">  </a> 

	<p> Causeplay New England was the first website that I was asked to create professionally. One of my high school friends founded a charitable Cosplay group (People who dress in as their favorite cartoon or comic book characters) that dresses up as Comic Book characters and attends other non-profit charity events such as the Special Olympics, Children's Cancer Hospitals, and Autism Awareness events. The founder confronted me and said he needed a new website, and I agree to do it for free due to my need of experience and the purpose of his group. as of April 2017, the website isn't finished completely due to other committments on both parties. Despite this, the most important parts are up and running here. </p>

	I'm still considering if this is worth showing. Thanks for looking at the source code though! 
	
	<h2> CSS Midterm - A showcase of what's possible </h2> <br /> 
	<a href="css_midterm/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project4.png"> </a> 
	<p> This was my CSS midterm project. The objective was to showcase what is possible with CSS opposed to creating a beautiful website. The website took advantage of promoting good color theory, pseudo CSS classes such as :hover and ::first-letter, fixed elements on a page, and subtle background images inside divs (such as the gradient banner on the top of the page). </p> -->


	<h2> Accurate Graphics Inc</h2>
	<a href="accurate_graphics/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project6.PNG"> </a>
	<p> During the Summer of 2017, I began interning at a sign installation company that was looking to expand their business into website design. Their previous website was created using a 'drag and drop wizard' on their hosting website. Although the drag and drop allowed for easy website implementation, it did not tell you how to make your website consistent and visually appealing. I re-created what they had from their drag and drop website and coded it myself. This was also my first website that I designed for mobile as well. The website has different styling for iPhone 5, 6, and 6+ screen sizes. </p>
	
	
	<h2> One paged, scrolling website </h2>
	<a href="onePageWebsite/index.html" target="_blank"> <img src="images/project8.png"></a>
	<p> After I created the Material Design website, I was challenged again to make something 'out of the ordinary'. After some research, I figured that a one-paged website was the best approach to creating a more unique website than before. Since our target market are local businesses, they don't have enough information to warrant the use of multiple website pages. </p>
